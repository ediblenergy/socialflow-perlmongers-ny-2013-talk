"A Bloom filter, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970 is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not." -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter

Bitly Dablooms: "This project aims to demonstrate a novel bloom filter implementation that can scale, and provide not only the addition of new members, but reliable removal of existing members." - https://github.com/bitly/dablooms
