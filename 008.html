     [10:26] &lt;edibsk&gt; hey paul, I'm doing a perlmongers ny.pm talk tonight about interesting perl projects at SocialFlow, I was thinking of briefly covering sfs3
     [10:27] &lt;edibsk&gt; so from a high level, is it a tool to parallelize uploads to s3, and can do multipart uploads concurrently on the same file?
     [10:29] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; Yes and no...
     [10:29] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; It's a tool to do parallel uploads, but it can't do concurrent uploads of multiple parts -within- one file
     [10:29] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; It's a massive pain to deal with S3, so there's lots of limitations
     [10:30] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; The primary thing that sfs3 does is allows storing of per-file metadata, so we can store the whole-file md5sum on S3 itself; something that has been hitherto literally impossible
     #....
     10:35] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; S3 _does not_ give you a whole-file md5sum for multipart files. Not at all
     [10:35] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; Nor, once it is uploaded, does S3 give you any way to get the etags of the pieces.
     [10:35] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; So what sfs3 does is stores data in a subspace called data/ and extra metadata in a space called meta/. One item of metadata is a tiny text file just containing the md5sum in nice easy ASCII
     [10:36] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; The reason it does that, rather than storing x-aws-meta-md5sum is that S3 does not give you _any_ way to set the metadata at the end.. only before you start
     [10:36] &lt;LeoNerd&gt; But if you're uploading a 20GB file you don't want to read it once off disk just to calculate the md5sum, before you read it a second time to upload it.
